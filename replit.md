# GodivaTech Website

## Overview

GodivaTech is a modern, full-stack web application for a technology company showcasing their services, projects, and blog content. The application features a React frontend with Vite, a Node.js/Express backend, and uses Firebase for authentication and data storage. It includes both a public-facing website and an admin dashboard for content management.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite with custom configuration
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom theme configuration
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui component library
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth page transitions and interactions
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **Authentication**: Dual authentication system (traditional + Firebase Auth)

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Runtime**: Node.js with ES modules
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL (with fallback to in-memory storage)

- **Bundle Analysis**: Automated bundle size monitoring and optimization
- **SEO**: Comprehensive SEO implementation with structured data and location-based targeting

## Data Flow

### Frontend Data Flow
1. User interactions trigger API calls through TanStack Query
2. Query client handles caching, error states, and loading states
3. Authentication state is managed globally with React Context
4. Form submissions use React Hook Form with Zod validation
5. Real-time updates via WebSocket connections for admin features

### Backend Data Flow
1. Express routes handle API endpoints with middleware for authentication
2. Drizzle ORM manages database operations with PostgreSQL
3. Firebase handles user authentication and session management
4. Cloudinary processes image uploads and transformations
5. In-memory fallback storage for development and testing

### Authentication Flow
1. Users can authenticate via traditional username/password or Firebase Auth
2. Sessions are managed server-side with secure cookie handling
3. Protected routes use authentication middleware
4. Admin dashboard requires elevated permissions
