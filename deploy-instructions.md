# Vercel Deployment Fix for SPA Routing

## Problem
The 404 errors occur because Vercel doesn't know how to handle client-side routing for Single Page Applications (SPAs).

## Solution Files Created

### 1. `client/vercel.json`
- Configures Vercel to handle SPA routing
- Redirects all non-API routes to `index.html`
- Proxies API calls to your Render backend
- Adds security headers and caching

### 2. `client/_redirects` & `client/public/_redirects`
- Backup configuration for SPA routing
- Works with both Vercel and Netlify

### 3. Updated `client/vite.config.ts`
- Added proper development server configuration

## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Redeploy on Vercel (Recommended)
1. Commit and push these new files to your repository
2. Vercel will automatically redeploy with the new configuration
3. The `vercel.json` file will ensure proper SPA routing

### Option 2: Manual Vercel Configuration
If auto-deploy doesn't work:
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Go to your project settings
3. Add these redirects manually:
   - Source: `/((?!api/).*)`
   - Destination: `/index.html`
   - Permanent: No

### Option 3: Environment Variables
Ensure these environment variables are set in Vercel:
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://godivatech-backend.onrender.com/api`
- All Firebase configuration variables

## What This Fixes
- ✅ `/about` will now load the React app
- ✅ `/services` will now load the React app  
- ✅ `/contact` will now load the React app
- ✅ `/blog` will now load the React app
- ✅ All other routes will work properly
- ✅ API calls will be proxied to your backend on Render

## Testing
After deployment, test these URLs:

### Static Routes
- https://godivatech.com/about
- https://godivatech.com/services  
- https://godivatech.com/contact
- https://godivatech.com/portfolio
- https://godivatech.com/blog

### Dynamic Routes (Previously Broken)
- https://godivatech.com/services/web-development
- https://godivatech.com/services/digital-marketing
- https://godivatech.com/blog/[any-blog-post-slug]
- https://godivatech.com/admin

### Expected Result
All URLs should load the React app instead of showing 404 errors.

## Complete Route Coverage
The updated configuration now handles:
- ✅ All static pages
- ✅ Dynamic service detail pages (/services/:slug)
- ✅ Dynamic blog post pages (/blog/:slug)  
- ✅ Blog category pages (/blog/category/:slug)
- ✅ All admin panel routes (/admin/*)
- ✅ Authentication page (/auth)
- ✅ API proxying to backend
- ✅ Static files (sitemap.xml, robots.txt)

This should resolve ALL the 404 issues you were experiencing.
